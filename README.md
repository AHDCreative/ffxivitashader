# ffxivitashader
Custom reshade build (unlocked z-depth) + shader preset for Final Fantasy 14.

# v1.X
FFXIVITAShade that uses Reshade 4.0. Use this if you want the latest and greatest from reshade. This is a major overhaul with a lot of new features for both normal and advanced users. It also has a revamped UI. Please note that as of the moment, **NOT ALL SHADERS/EFFECTS** are compatible with Reshade 4.0. I currently don't have an official list but if it doesn't work in-game, then that shader/effect is not (yet) supported.
